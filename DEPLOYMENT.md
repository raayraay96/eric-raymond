# ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions

Your portfolio site has been successfully converted to a static site and is ready for GitHub Pages deployment!

## Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

The site is configured to automatically deploy when you push to the `main` branch:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
   - The site will be available at: https://raayraay96.github.io/eric-raymond/

2. **Push any changes to main:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Check deployment status:**
   - Go to the Actions tab in your repository
   - Watch the deployment workflow progress
   - Once complete, visit your site!

## Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run deploy
```

## What's Been Done

âœ… **Static Site Conversion:**
- Moved all data files to `frontend/public/data/`
- Created static data service
- Removed backend dependencies
- Updated all API calls to fetch static JSON

âœ… **GitHub Pages Setup:**
- Added deploy scripts to package.json
- Created GitHub Actions workflow
- Configured Vite for GitHub Pages base path
- Added gh-pages dev dependency

âœ… **3D Robotic Arm:**
- Interactive cursor tracking
- Smooth inverse kinematics
- Professional materials and lighting

2. **Wait for first deployment** (takes 2-5 minutes)
3. **Visit your live site** at https://raayraay96.github.io/eric-raymond/

## Customizing Content

To update your portfolio content:

1. Edit JSON files in `frontend/public/data/`:
   - `projects.json` - Timeline/project entries
   - `mockProjects.json` - Portfolio showcase items
   - `skills.json` - Technical skills
   - `jobs.json` - Work experience
   - `education.json` - Education info
   - `leadership.json` - Leadership roles

2. Commit and push changes - the site will automatically rebuild!

## Performance Tips

- The 3D scene is optimized for 60fps
- Images should be optimized before adding
- Keep JSON files reasonably sized
- Use code splitting for new features

Enjoy your new interactive portfolio! ðŸŽ‰

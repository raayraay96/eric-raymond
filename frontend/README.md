# 🌐 Christopher Raymond – Over-Engineered Personal Website

Welcome! This is my **developer portfolio site**, built not just to show off my work—but to **demonstrate how I engineer**. I’ve taken a simple project (a personal website) and layered in real-world practices you'd expect in a production-grade system.

> Think of this site as an open-source resume _and_ a code sample.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project showcases my ability to:

- Build and scale full-stack applications
- Write clean, maintainable TypeScript (both frontend and backend)
- Set up efficient tooling and developer workflows
- Architect systems with growth in mind
- Work across the entire stack: from UI to API, infra to automation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Overview

### Frontend

- **React + TypeScript**
- **Vite** (fast builds + hot reloading)
- **Tailwind CSS** for atomic, responsive styling
- **FontAwesome** for icons
- **Axios** for API communication

### Backend

- **Node.js + Express (TypeScript)**
- **Mock JSON-based REST API**
- Ready for future swap-in with a real DB (e.g., Postgres or DynamoDB)

### Tooling / DX

- **Prettier + ESLint** for consistent code style
- **Husky + lint-staged** for pre-commit formatting
- **Modular, testable structure** using service layers
- **Concurrent dev servers** for full-stack iteration

---

## 🧭 Features

- 🚀 Responsive UI with Tailwind
- 🧩 Modular pages: `Home`, `About`, `Portfolio`
- 🔌 Connected to a mock API backend
- ✅ Type-safe, linted, and formatted across the stack
- 🔁 Git hooks to maintain consistency pre-commit
- 🧪 Ready for future integration testing

## 👨‍💼 For Recruiters & Hiring Managers

- 🔹 This project is intentionally **over-engineered** to showcase production-level thinking.
- 🔹 My **focus is backend and infrastructure**, but I enjoy working across the full stack.
- 🔹 I’ve worked in **fast-paced startup environments** and thrive in cross-functional teams.
- 🔹 I’m comfortable with **DevOps**, **scalable system design**, and **low-level networking (IoT)**.

If you're evaluating engineering candidates for roles requiring **ownership**, **cross-discipline skills**, and **real-world pragmatism**—this project is designed to show what I bring to the table.
